// Question 3: Create a class called Complex, which has two private instance variables â€“ real and imaginary.
// It contains a method called add() which takes one Complex object as a parameter and prints the added value
// of the calling Complex object and passes the Complex object. In the main method, declare two Complex objects
// and assign values using the constructor and call the add() method.
